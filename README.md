# MNIST Handwritten Digits Recognition using ANN

## Overview

This project implements a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Setup

1. Install required libraries like Tensorflow

## Model Architecture

The neural network model consists of:

- Input Layer: Flatten layer for flattening the 28x28 images.
- Hidden Layer1: Dense layer with 300 neurons and ReLU activation.
- Hidden Layer2: Dense layer with 100 neurons and ReLU activation.
- Output Layer: Dense layer with 10 neurons (for 10 classes) and softmax activation.

## Training

The model is trained using the MNIST training dataset. The training process involves 30 epochs with a batch size of 32.

## Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on the MNIST test dataset, achieving a test accuracy of 97%.
